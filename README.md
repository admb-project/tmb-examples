# tmb-examples

This is a collection of TMB examples hosted by the ADMB Foundation. They may be similar but not identical to examples found elsewhere.

## [Minimal](https://github.com/admb-project/tmb-examples/tree/master/minimal)
Minimal example that uses maximum likelihood estimation to find the mean and variance of a normally distributed variable.

This example is based on a template that comes with Emacs [tmb-mode](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/blob/master/emacs/tmb.el).

## [Linear Regression](https://github.com/admb-project/tmb-examples/tree/master/linear-regression)
Simple linear regression, estimating a slope and an intercept while assuming normally distributed errors.

This example is used in a YouTube **video** called [TMB tutorial: The basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5CLrhzNzVU&list=PLG2Iwmq6WW1QMUA43675d8XdmzgrgwDYX).

## Orange Trees
This example was previously developed for ADMB, R, and OpenBUGS as part of an [NCEAS working group](https://groups.nceas.ucsb.edu/non-linear-modeling/projects). A full description of the assumptions of the model can be found there.

## Multivariate Normal
This example fits a multivariate normal distribution to simulated data.

**An accompanying video is available [here]().**
