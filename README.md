# tmb-examples

This is a collection of TMB examples produced by the ADMB Foundation. They may be similar but not identical to examples found elsewhere.

## Minimal
This is a minimal example that uses maximum likelihood estimation to find the mean and variance of a normally distributed variable. 

## Linear Regression
This is a very minimal example of how to do a linear regression to estimate a slope and an intercept while assuming normally distributed errors.

## Orange Trees
This example was previously developed for ADMB, R, and OpenBUGS as part of an [NCEAS working group](https://groups.nceas.ucsb.edu/non-linear-modeling/projects). A full description of the assumptions of the model can be found there.

## Multivariate Normal
This example fits a multivariate normal distribution to simulated data.
