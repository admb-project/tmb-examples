# tmb-examples

This is a collection of TMB examples hosted by the ADMB Foundation. They may be similar but not identical to examples found elsewhere.

## [Minimal](minimal)
Minimal example that uses maximum likelihood estimation to find the mean and variance of a normally distributed variable.

This example is based on a template that comes with Emacs [tmb-mode](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/blob/master/emacs/tmb.el).

## [Linear Regression](linear-regression)
Simple linear regression, estimating a slope and an intercept while assuming normally distributed errors.

This example is used in a **YouTube video** called [TMB tutorial: The basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5CLrhzNzVU&list=PLG2Iwmq6WW1QMUA43675d8XdmzgrgwDYX).

## [Orange Trees](orange-trees)
Nonlinear mixed-effects model: logistic growth of trees, where the asymptotic maximum varies between trees.

This example was previously developed to compare ADMB, R, and BUGS as part of an [NCEAS working group](https://groups.nceas.ucsb.edu/non-linear-modeling/projects). A full description of the model can be found there.

## Multivariate Normal
This example fits a multivariate normal distribution to simulated data.
